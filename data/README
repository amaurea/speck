Beam release 150608 for ACTpol [PA1,PA2] 2014
ML (adapted from MFH) - Mon Jun  8 18:38:12 2015

1. This beam release consists of paired ell-space beam function and
real-space radial profile pairs.

  beam_tform_150608_2014_<array>_<suffix>.txt   -- ell-space beam transform
  beam_profile_150608_2014_<array>_<suffix>.txt -- real space radial profile


2. The suffices in use here are:

  instant -- instantaneous beam, only appropriate for analysis of
      single TODs or single-TOD maps.

  jitter -- beam suitable for use on field maps, because pointing
      variance correction and uncertainty have been applied. You must
      take into account the pixel window function separately.


3. The format of the ell-space beam transforms is:

  Column 1: ell
  Column 2: B_ell
  Columns 3,4,...: dB1_ell,  dB2_ell, ...

B_ell is the harmonic transform of the real space beam, assumed to be
azimuthally symmetric.  The angular power spectrum "window function"
due to the instrument point spread function is proportional to the
square of B_ell.

Each dB#_ell is an independent mode of the uncertainty in B_ell.  To
average a result over the ensemble of beam realizations, generate
trial beams

  B' = B + a1 * dB1 + a2 * dB2 + ...

where (a1, a2, ...) are drawn from the normal distribution with mean 0
and variance 1.

The normalization ell and error mode pivot ell can be found in the
comments of each beam_tform file.


4. The format of the real space radial profile is:

  Column 1: radius, in degrees
  Column 2: beam profile, normalized to 1 at radius = 0
